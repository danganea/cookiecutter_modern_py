# Minimal modern Python cookiecutter.

This is a minimal cookiecutter for setting up modern Python projects. It's useful when you want to quickly whip up a demo/test project but still want to get all the benefits of linting, auto-formatting, modern package management and a minimal Dockerfile.

Since it is both very minimal and very opinionated, it does not come with any custom configuration when running cookiecutter.
